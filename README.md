# Frank Reibold's Repository

I want to share my experiences with programming languages.

## GUI Frameworks

* The best GUI framework for C++ is *U++*
* The best GUI framework for C and Fortran is *AppGraphics* from *Approximatrix*
## Benchmarks

It's a pleasure for me that modern BASIC compilers like *QB64PE* are about as fast as C :-)
